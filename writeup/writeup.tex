I was able to attend all of the meetings, except for the one on an SDP
algorithm for recovering communities in a stochastic block model graph. I
primarily studied the papers and notes relevant for my own presentations, but skimmed
over some of the relevant material for some of the other presentations as
well. I presented on the max clique in a random graph, specifically regarding
the size of the max clique for a graph $G \sim \mathcal{G}_{n, \frac{1}{2}}$,
and the derivations of the upper and lower bounds on the size of the max
clique, using Markov's inequality and the second moment method, respectively. I
also presented on the AKS spectral algorithm for recovering a planted clique,
specifically on the correctness of the algorithm in the rounding procedures
done to recover the clique.

I've attached following the notes for the presentations I presented on. We all
collaborated equally on all the presentations. An implementation of the AKS
spectral algorithm for recovering a planted clique from a $\mathcal{G}_{n,
\frac{1}{2}}$ was also coded up

by Wilson.
